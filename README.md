# The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and practice files I have completed as part of [*The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-full-stack-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, showcase the concepts I've learned, and provide a reference for future use or additional learning. Each folder corresponds to a different section, chapter, or topic in the course and may include its own README or instructions.
