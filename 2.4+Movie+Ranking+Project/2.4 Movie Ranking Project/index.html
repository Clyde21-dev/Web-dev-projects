<h2>My top 3 Worst movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Captain America: Brave New World</h3>

<p>This movie is anything but brave. It is the most feckless, spineless blockbuster of the last decade, 
a film in need of burning down the old world before daring to look for the new. </p>

<h3>Back in Action</h3>

<p>Glenn Close is well-cast as Emily’s estranged mother, a former spy herself who remains formidable long after her own retirement. 
But Andrew Scott goes woefully to waste as an MI6 agent who’s been on the hunt for Emily, and this desirable, powerful key, 
for his own personal reasons. One of our most startling and assured actors working today, Scott gets nothing to play and looks totally bored every time he’s on screen.
 As “Back in Action” drags on and on, we know exactly how he feels. </p>

<h3>Red One</h3>

<p>“Red One” may scratch at some interesting ideas about lamenting the world’s cruelties, it lacks the narrative depth and commitment to fully explore its angst. 
    After his abduction, Simmons’ Santa spends most of the film in a comatose state, his power slowly drained from him. That encapsulates the feeling of watching this film; 
    a state of unconsciousness might be the best way to enjoy it.</p>
